SALES SENSE is a sales data analysis Project for retail stores that uses a statitical approach to understand the sales performance.

Business Use Case :
In a competitive retail environment, understanding sales performance is crucial for making 
informed business decisions. Retail managers need insights into which products are 
performing well, the average sales volume, and variations across different categories to 
optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

Problem Statement :
The retail store has observed fluctuating sales numbers across various product categories. 
The management wants to analyze the sales data to: 
1. Identify trends and patterns in sales. 
2. Determine if the average sales volume significantly differs from a target value (e.g., 
20 units). 
3. Provide insights into sales performance across different product categories. 

Objectives :
1. Perform descriptive statistics to summarize sales data. 
2. Conduct inferential statistics to test hypotheses regarding average sales. 
3. Visualize sales performance for better decision-making.

Conclusion 
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of sales data for a retail store, focusing 
on both descriptive and inferential statistics. The insights gained from this analysis can 
help management make data-driven decisions regarding inventory and marketing 
strategies.
